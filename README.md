This project was created to automate the process of translating assembly program instructions, into binary machine code to later be inserted in the Instructions Memory of a Pepe-8 CPU. This code is used to implement the instruction memory of this kind of CPUs.

### Usage

* The user specifies the size of the program (number of instructions);
* The user selects the register to write or read data from;
* The user inserts decimal constants that is automatically converted to 8bit binary;
* The machine code is automatically generated;
